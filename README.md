How can we improve multi-label classification when the output space is structuredl ike an ontology? We introduce a framework which allows for the incorporation ofclass structures contained in an ontology by assigning a centroid and radius to each class, and creating a learning objective that takes these constraints into account. We empirically show the framework is effective by restricting the learned output spaceto be 2-dimensional and visualizing the embedding produced by models using this framework. Finally, we also evaluated the impact different ontology embeddings would have on the accuracy of the models using this framework.
